- AWS Bracket (a quantum computing infrastructure)
- Azure Quantum service
- Tensoflow Quantum

2. Semi-Supervised Learning

3. Model Serving

4. MLFlow

5. Meta Machine Learning
- dozens of learning paradigms that sit between "supervised" and "unsupervised" learning
- based on learning to learn 
- The Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) technique explores how meta-learning can be ubiquitously applied to incredibly diverse deep learning models
- Comet.ml is a Platform for Meta Machine Learning (GitHub of machine learning)

6. Data Labeling
- Supervised learning models need labeled datasets for training, and those are expensive to create and maintain
- Labeling text datasets is different from labeling images, and that is different from labeling video or audio
- platforms such as Labelbox, Snorkel.ai, and Scale AI drive innovation into the space




# Cool AI Tech releases
