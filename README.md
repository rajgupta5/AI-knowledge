- AWS Bracket (a quantum computing infrastructure)
- Azure Quantum service
- Tensoflow Quantum

2. Semi-Supervised Learning


3. Model Serving

4. MLFlow

5. Meta Machine Learning
- dozens of learning paradigms that sit between "supervised" and "unsupervised" learning
- based on learning to learn 
- The Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) technique explores how meta-learning can be ubiquitously applied to incredibly diverse deep learning models
- Comet.ml is a Platform for Meta Machine Learning (GitHub of machine learning)

6. Data Labeling
- Supervised learning models need labeled datasets for training, and those are expensive to create and maintain
- Labeling text datasets is different from labeling images, and that is different from labeling video or audio
- platforms such as Labelbox, Snorkel.ai, and Scale AI drive innovation into the space
- Snorkel Flow is a Platform to Unlock the Training Data Bottleneck in Machine Learning (https://www.snorkel.ai/)
- Labelbox is a Data Labeling Platform for your Machine Learning Models


7. Machine Teaching
- machine teaching is conceptually simple and based on the creation of intelligent models that can teach other models
- given a set of machine learning models, a dataset, and a target task; determine the most efficient teachers to optimize the learning process
- https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07768 (Uber proposes a technique known as generative teaching networks (GTNs) to accelerate the training and evaluation of machine learning models.)

8. Reinformcement Learning
- Acme: A new framework for distributed reinforcement learning

9. Unsupervised Data Augmentation
- technique for addressing the challenges of training semi-supervised learning models with small labeled datasets.


10 NLP
- Researchers at Google have developed a new deep-learning model called ![BigBird](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/09/google-bigbird-nlp/?utm_source=notification_email&utm_campaign=notifications&utm_medium=link&utm_content=content_in_followed_topic&utm_term=daily) that allows Transformer neural networks to process sequences up to 8x longer than previously possible
